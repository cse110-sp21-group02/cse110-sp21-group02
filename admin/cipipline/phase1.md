# CI/CD Pipeline Status  
## This document provides a status update on the current state of our CI/CD pipeline and outlines the planned and in-progress improvements. The pipeline aims to automate and streamline our software development process, ensuring code quality, efficient testing, and timely delivery of reliable software.

# Current Functionalities
The following functionalities are currently implemented and functional in our CI/CD pipeline:

## 1. ESLinting
ESLint is integrated into the pipeline, providing static code analysis to identify and enforce coding standards and best practices. It helps ensure that our codebase adheres to consistent style guidelines and avoids common errors.

However, it is worth noting that we are continuously refining our ESLint rules and configurations to optimize its effectiveness and customize it for our specific project requirements.

## 2. Manual PR Checking
Before merging any code changes into the main branch, our developers manually review and test pull requests (PRs). This step allows for a comprehensive review of the proposed changes and ensures that the code meets our quality standards, design principles, and business requirements.

Although manual PR checking provides a thorough assessment, it can introduce delays in the development process. Therefore, we are actively working on automating this step to improve efficiency and reduce the time to merge code changes.

# Planned and In-Progress Improvements
To enhance our CI/CD pipeline, we have identified several planned and in-progress improvements:

## 1. Codacy Integration
We are in the process of integrating Codacy, an automated code quality tool, into our pipeline. Codacy will analyze our codebase, detect issues, and provide detailed reports on code quality, code duplication, security vulnerabilities, and more. By automating this process, we aim to identify and address code quality issues early in the development lifecycle.

## 2. Automatic JS Docs Generation
To improve code documentation and maintain up-to-date API references, we are working on integrating an automatic JS documentation generation tool. This tool will extract code comments and generate comprehensive API documentation, ensuring that our codebase remains well-documented and easier to understand for both current and future developers.

## 3. Jest Unit Tests
While we currently have manual testing in place during the PR checking phase, we recognize the importance of automated unit testing to ensure the stability and correctness of our codebase. We are actively working on integrating Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, into our pipeline. Jest will allow us to write and execute automated unit tests, providing faster feedback on the correctness of our code changes.

# Conclusion
In summary, our CI/CD pipeline currently incorporates ESLinting and manual PR checking. We are actively working on integrating Codacy for automated code quality analysis, implementing automatic JS documentation generation, and integrating Jest for automated unit testing. These improvements will enhance the efficiency, code quality, and reliability of our software development process.

We remain committed to continuously improving our CI/CD pipeline and embracing industry best practices to deliver high-quality software efficiently and effectively.
