### App looks nice
* Nice user experience with the clouds in the background
* Cute theme is very welcoming and fitting our purpose of comforting the user
* Clean layout and transitions are smooth, feels more natural
* Text is split to be behind cards to make it more readable and less overwhelming

### App is functional
* Basic features that we wanted initially were all implemented
* App works without bugs for the most part
* User get a customized experience by renaming their fortune

### Progress made late
* Confusion between frontend and backend team inhibited progress
* Contribution to the project was a lot slower without in person meetings
* More accountability once in person meetings were implemented

### Action items (Things to consider for next time)
* Meet often, more than once a week if possible
* Meet in person as much as possible
* Stay on top of version control

## Next steps:
* Final polishing of the web app
* Filming, editing and submitting the video
