## Research Sharing
Aaron’s ideas:
* Historical background is heavy
* Cultures and people have different views of accuracy
* Thought distortion: a psychological term used to describe constantly thinking bad outcomes will occur
* Challenged religion: only god was to foresee future events

Daniel’s ideas: 
* Astrology could be incorporated
* Found fortune telling websites
* Light and warm tone, welcoming, direct access
* Also found a darker tone, more mysterious vibe website

Zheng’s ideas:
* Have main functions work first
* specific inputs shouldn’t output the same thing each time necessarily
* Make accessible on phone
* Link sharing your results
* Using open APIs, ML
* Get user info? Surveys?

Zichen’s ideas:
* 4 types of people that would use it
1. Student: young people turned fortune-telling during COVID, gave them peace of mind
2. Older people: have more spare time, stressed about the future (how long they have to live)
3. People who have had difficulties in life: lack security, stressed about life
4. For fun: just use it for entertainment

Ian’s ideas:
* There's an actual market for fortune telling, “rent a fortune teller”
* In contrast: there are short quizzes made just for fun
* Ideas differ highly: serious market vs entertainment
* **Are we going to have everything locally based? Cloud-based?**
* Locally: could get boring/repetitive
* Cloud: harder to implement
* **How to keep users engaged?**
* **How do we approach our app? Serious or fun?**

Preston’s ideas:
* Chat room websites
* Focus on astrology and horoscopes
* Faladdin: take a picture of your coffee and it gives fortune
* Death predictor app
* Palm reading apps that analyze your palms
* Co-star: raised 5 million dollars for fortune telling!

Jane’s ideas:
* How can we make our app appeal to different users
* Give reading that reflects what they are looking for
* Possibility of features not working properly
