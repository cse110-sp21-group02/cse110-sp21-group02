# Branching/Repo Organization
* For those confused for branching, put all code in the source folder and commit everything to the dev branch
* CI/CD JSDoc has been added but we still don't have CD done
* Testing as part of the pipeline needs to be implemented
* Daniel will spearhead finishing up the pipeline, getting help from TAs OH and lab hours

# Communication
* Use the slack channel more, when there is confusion just ask for clarification
* Always let the team know when you can't make a meeting

# Frontend
* Figma, priotize it make sure its accurate to what features 
* Communicate to Leon the importance and priority of getting a detailed and accurate figma 

# Standups
* Don't give updates on the individual components of the class
* Be honest in standups if there is nothing to report, if you aren't working on anything just write nothing, no shame, it's fine

## Next steps:
* Set up meeting within subteams to discuss issues for next sprint before Friday meeting
* Get Team status video done by Tuesday
