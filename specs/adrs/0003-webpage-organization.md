# Web app page organization

## Context and Problem Statement

We are developing a web app and need to decide if it will run on a single web page or multiple

## Considered Options

*   Multiple pages for homepage and history page
*   Simulate different pages by hiding and unhiding elements as needed

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Simulate different pages by hiding and unhiding elements as needed, we decided to use a singlge html page rather than multiple to keep things simpler. Currently our app does not have enough complexity to warrant needed a second page.
