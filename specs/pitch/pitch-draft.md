## Solution
### Statement of Purpose/Goals:
Purpose: To have an outlet that provides people with unique and positive insights into the future while also being a source of entertainment. To accomplish this we will be using tarot cards as it is a common fortune telling method and there are many people who believe in it. It is interactive, has a lot of visual appeal and would work well in an app so this is the type of fortune telling that will help us achieve our purpose the best. To get a wide user base our intention is to design the app for both web and phone users. 

### Features:
Basic: 
Three card tarot reading for user input
Adjustable screen size for desktop or mobile
Offline support in response generation

Additional:
Personalized respones from Chat GPT API
Link sharing
Voice Interaction
Animation while waiting for response

### UI/UX:

## Rabbit Holes
1. Data: depending on the app design and features we would need to store and write a large amount of custom fortunes. Workaround: Use an AI generative system, implement as an additional feature if time allows.
2. Design: designing from CSS is difficult to visualize and will delay the team's view of the project. Before any front end coding we will create a Figma and aim to exactly replicate the design on there.
3. Complexity/clutter: lots of fortune telling apps are filled with tons of features that take a lot of time to implement and would distract from the rest of the design. We will focus on using a single standard tarot card deck.
4. Avoid adding too many features at once to the app. Start off with coding the necessary features then add the other additional features once the necessary features are working properly. Follow the workflow timeline specified in the Appitite portion.

## No Gos
1. No external databases.
2. Tarot card reading diversity, there are many different readings that can be performed and we don’t have time for all of them. To avoid getting lost we will focus first on a simple 3 card reading.
3. Changing to a non-standard Tarot card deck.
